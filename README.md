This repository is dedicated to drawings of circuits schematics by means of LaTeX (circuitikz).
All drawings are in the public domain.
Contributions are welcomed.


## Organization
Source files containing the LaTeX (circuitikz) code are organized as follows:
- [bicmos](./bicmos) for circuits whose architectures mix bipolar and CMOS transitors,
- [bipolar](./bipolar) for circuits whose architectures are based on bipolar transistors,
- [cmos](./cmos) for circuits whose architectures are based on CMOS transistors,
- [opamp](./opamp) for circuits using operational amplifiers (symbols).
